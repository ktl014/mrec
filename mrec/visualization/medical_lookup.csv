SPONTANOUS PAIN,"Spontaneous pain may often be stimulus-evoked pain, where the stimulus goes unrecognized because it is generated by the activities of daily life (both external stimuli and the internal stimuli that are produced by normal physiological processes)"
RSD,"Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSD) is a disorder that causes lasting pain, usually in an arm or leg, and it shows up after an injury, stroke, or even heart attack. But the severity of pain is typically worse than the original injury itself. Doctors don’t know exactly what causes it, but they are able to treat many cases."
