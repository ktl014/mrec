term,description
SPONTANOUS PAIN,"Spontaneous pain may often be stimulus-evoked pain, where the stimulus goes unrecognized because it is generated by the activities of daily life (both external stimuli and the internal stimuli that are produced by normal physiological processes)"
RSD,"Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSD) is a disorder that causes lasting pain, usually in an arm or leg, and it shows up after an injury, stroke, or even heart attack. But the severity of pain is typically worse than the original injury itself. Doctors don’t know exactly what causes it, but they are able to treat many cases."
PAROXYSMAL SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA,"Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is a type of abnormal heart rhythm, or arrhythmia. It occurs when a short circuit rhythm develops in the upper chamber of the heart. This results in a regular but rapid heartbeat that starts and stops abruptly."
PROPAFENONE,Propafenone is used to prevent irregular heartbeats such as atrial fibrillation (AF) from occurring again in patients who do not have structural heart disease. Propafenone belongs to the group of medicines known as antiarrhythmics. It works directly on the heart tissue and will slow the nerve impulses in the heart.
INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS,"Infective endocarditis, also called bacterial endocarditis, is an infection caused by bacteria that enter the bloodstream and settle in the heart lining, a heart valve or a blood vessel. IE is uncommon, but people with some heart conditions have a greater risk of developing it."
BACTERIA,"A member of a large group of unicellular microorganisms which have cell walls but lack organelles and an organized nucleus, including some that can cause disease."
